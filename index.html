      Hi strangers! My name is Chenfei Tang. I am an undergraduate physics
      student at University of Rochester (UR) at upstate New York in USA!
      Currently, my research interest includes but not limit to Experimental
      Quantum Information Processing (Trapped Ion), Particle Physics,
      Computational Dynamic System,etc. Life is short! But it's always fun to do
      some physics during your limited lifetime!
    </p>

    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I am from Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. My hometown, Suzhou, was famous for the
      river view. I have lived in Suzhou throughout my childhood. Until my
      eighteens, I started my college at University Rochester. Now, I live in
      Rochester, New York State. Rochester is a very friendly town. I meet some
      of my best friends there.
      <br />
      Here are some
      <a href="note.html">notes</a> on physics and math that I take during my
      journary of physics.
      <br />
      Here are some
      <a href="picture.html">pictures</a> I took when travelling!

    <h3>About My Research Interest</h3>
    <p>
      As I said, my research interest is Quantum Computing by Trapped Ion. You
      may wonder what does this mean? Briefly speaking, quantum computing is a
      type of computing that Quantum Mechanics dominant the underlying
      computation process. Quantum computing , in some certain circumstance, can
      be exponetially faster than classical computing. Trapped Ion is a type of
      "setting" that can implement Quantum Computing.
    </p>
    <h3>About Travelling</h3>
    <p>
      Until now, I have been to 12 countries: France, Netherland, Italy,
      Swissland, Vantican, Monaco, Thailand, Japan, USA, Russia, Denmark,
      Iceland. I like travelling and talking to people from different countries.
      I still plan going to these following countries: Ferro Island, Greenland,
      Eygpt, Argentinan, Peru, Australia,
    </p>
    <h3>About Postcrossing!</h3>
    <p>
      Postcrossing is one of my hobbies. I got known of postcrossing in the
      summer before college. I started postcrossing once I entered the
      college.It's a fun activity. Until now, I have exchange
